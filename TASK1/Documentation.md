# Observations from the given verilog code and PCF file
## Purpose of the Module
The top module is a simple hardware design that uses an internal high-frequency oscillator to drive a counter.

Controls an RGB LED using a dedicated RGB driver primitive.

Demonstrates internal oscillator usage and visual output on hardware LEDs for verification or debugging purposes.

## Description of Internal Logic and Oscillator
frequency_counter_i:

A 28-bit counter (reg [27:0] frequency_counter_i) is incremented on every rising edge of the internal oscillator clock (int_osc).

This counter is used as a simple activity indicator and can be tapped to drive various outputs.

int_osc: Internal Oscillator

Configured via CLKHF_DIV = "0b10", which sets the oscillator division factor (typically gives 12 MHz from a 48 MHz base).

Always enabled with CLKHFPU = 1'b1 and CLKHFEN = 1'b1.

## Functionality of the RGB LED Driver
SB_RGBA_DRV: RGB Driver Primitive

This Lattice-specific primitive controls three color channels: Red, Green, Blue.

The driver is always enabled via RGBLEDEN = 1'b1.

Color intensities are defined via:

RGB0PWM, RGB1PWM, RGB2PWM: PWM inputs for red, green, and blue respectively.

In the top.v code:

RGB0PWM = 1'b0 → Red OFF

RGB1PWM = 1'b0 → Green OFF

RGB2PWM = 1'b1 → Blue ON (constant)

Output signals RGB0, RGB1, and RGB2 are mapped to led_red, led_green, and led_blue.

## Current Drive Configuration
RGBx_CURRENT parameters are set to "0b000001" for each channel.

This specifies a minimal current drive for safe low-brightness operation.

test Wire Output:

testwire is driven by bit 5 of the frequency counter.

It toggles periodically based on oscillator frequency — useful for debugging or scope probing.
