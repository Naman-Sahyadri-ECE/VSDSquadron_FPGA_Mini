<summary>TASK1:Understanding and Implementing the Verilog Code on the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini Board</summary>

## Observations from the given verilog code and PCF file
## Purpose of the Module
The top module is a simple hardware design that uses an internal high-frequency oscillator to drive a counter.

Controls an RGB LED using a dedicated RGB driver primitive.

Demonstrates internal oscillator usage and visual output on hardware LEDs for verification or debugging purposes.

## Description of Internal Logic and Oscillator
frequency_counter_i:

A 28-bit counter (reg [27:0] frequency_counter_i) is incremented on every rising edge of the internal oscillator clock (int_osc).

This counter is used as a simple activity indicator and can be tapped to drive various outputs.

int_osc: Internal Oscillator

Configured via CLKHF_DIV = "0b10", which sets the oscillator division factor (typically gives 12 MHz from a 48 MHz base).

Always enabled with CLKHFPU = 1'b1 and CLKHFEN = 1'b1.

## Functionality of the RGB LED Driver
SB_RGBA_DRV: RGB Driver Primitive

This Lattice-specific primitive controls three color channels: Red, Green, Blue.

The driver is always enabled via RGBLEDEN = 1'b1.

Color intensities are defined via:

RGB0PWM, RGB1PWM, RGB2PWM: PWM inputs for red, green, and blue respectively.

In the top.v code:

RGB0PWM = 1'b0 â†’ Red OFF

RGB1PWM = 1'b0 â†’ Green OFF

RGB2PWM = 1'b1 â†’ Blue ON (constant)

Output signals RGB0, RGB1, and RGB2 are mapped to led_red, led_green, and led_blue.

## Current Drive Configuration
RGBx_CURRENT parameters are set to "0b000001" for each channel.

This specifies a minimal current drive for safe low-brightness operation.

test Wire Output:

testwire is driven by bit 5 of the frequency counter.

It toggles periodically based on oscillator frequency â€” useful for debugging or scope probing.


## From the given PCF file Pin Mapping and Functional Overview

|Signal |Assigned Pin  | Function in Verilog| Hardware Role | 
|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| led_red  | 	Pin 39 | Connected to RGB0 of SB_RGBA_DRV | Controls the red channel of the onboard RGB LED  |
| led_green  | 	Pin 41 | Connected to RGB1 of SB_RGBA_DRV | Controls the green channel of the onboard RGB LED  |
| led_blue  | 	Pin 40 | Connected to RGB2 of SB_RGBA_DRV | Controls the blue channel of the onboard RGB LED  |
| hw_clk | 	Pin 20 | Declared but unused in current Verilog code |Reserved for an external hardware clock input; currently inactive  |
| testwire | Pin 17 | Assigned to frequency_counter_i[5] |Outputs a toggling signal derived from the internal oscillator for testing purposes  |

# Integrating with the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini Board:
cd

cd VSDSquadron_FM

cd RGB

lsusb

make clean

make build

sudo make flash

Now i observed that i can see only blue colour led is ON because in the given code only blue pin was enabled to 1b'1 and  if i enable other pins also the colour doesn't change frequently. 

This was my output in initially:


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d142d73c-bf77-4a6c-8d5a-2f08299026ec


So i made the necessary changes in the code to get the RGB output, I changed the following part of the code:
 
 SB_RGBA_DRV RGB_DRIVER (
    
    .RGBLEDEN(1'b1                                            ),
    
    .RGB0PWM (frequency_counter_i[24]&frequency_counter_i[23] ),
    
    .RGB1PWM (frequency_counter_i[24]&~frequency_counter_i[23]),
    
    .RGB2PWM (~frequency_counter_i[24]&frequency_counter_i[23]),
    
    .CURREN  (1'b1                                            ),
    
    .RGB0    (led_red                                       ), //Actual Hardware connection
    
    .RGB1    (led_green                                       ),
    
    .RGB2    (led_blue                                        )
  
  );

  
And the my final output is as shown below:

<summary>TASK2: Implement a UART loopback mechanism where transmitted data is immediately received back, facilitating testing of UART functionality.</summary>

 # Step 1: Study the Existing Code
UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) is a hardware communication protocol used for serial communication between devices. It consists of two main data lines: the TX (Transmit) pin and the RX (Receive) pin. Specifically, a UART loopback mechanism is a test or diagnostic mode where data, which is transmitted to the TX (transmit) pin is directly routed back to the RX (receive) pin of the same module. This allows the system to verify that the TX and RX lines function correctly without the need of an external device.

## Analysis of Existing Code:

### Port Analysis:
The module explains six ports:
- Three RGB LED outputs (led_red, led_blue, led_green)
- UART transmit/receive pins (uarttx, uartrx)
- System clock input (hw_clk)

### Internal Component Analysis:

1.Internal Oscilliator (SB_HFOSC)
- Implements a high-frequency oscillator
- Uses CLKHF_DIV = "0b10" for frequency division
- Generates internal clock signal (int_osc)

2.Frequency Counter
- 28-bit counter (frequency_counter_i)
- Increments on every positive edge of internal oscillator
-Used for timing generation

3.UART Loopback
- Direct connection between transmit and receive pins
- Echoes back any received UART data immediately
  
4.RGB LED Driver (SB_RGBA_DRV)
- Controls three RGB channels
- Uses PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) for brightness control
- Current settings configured for each channel
- Maps UART input directly to LED intensity

##### UART Input Processing:
- Received UART data appears on uartrx pin
- Data is immediately looped back out through uarttx
- Same data drives all RGB channels simultaneously

#### LED Control
- RGB driver converts UART signal to PWM output
- All LEDs respond identically to input signal
- Current limiting set to minimum (0b000001) for each channel

<summary>TASK3:  Develop a UART transmitter module capable of sending serial data from the FPGA to an external device.</summary>

 ## Objective: 
Develop a UART transmitter module capable of sending serial data from the FPGA to an external device.
### Step 1: Study the Existing Code

A UART transmitter module is a hardware component that enables serial communication from an FPGA to external devices by converting parallel data into sequential bits . This module serves as a fundamental interface for sending data between the FPGA and external devices such as computers, microcontrollers, or other electronic equipment.It is sourced from this [repository](https://github.com/thesourcerer8/VSDSquadron_FM/tree/main/uart_tx).

### Module Overview
This is a VHDL implementation of an 8N1 UART transmitter module designed for Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The module handles asynchronous serial data transmission with specific parameters:
- 8 data bits
- No parity bit
- 1 stop bit

### State Machine Operation
1. **IDLE State (*STATE_IDLE*)**
   - Maintains TX line high (idle condition)
   - Waits for senddata trigger
   - Resets txdone flag
2. **STARTTX State (*STATE_STARTTX*)**
   - Transmits start bit (logic low)
   - Loads transmission buffer with txbyte
   - Immediately transitions to *TXING* state
3. **TXING State (*STATE_TXING*)**
   - Sends data bits sequentially
   - Shifts buffer right for next bit
   - Counts transmitted bits (0-7)
   - Continues until all 8 bits sent
4. **TXDONE State (*STATE_TXDONE*)**
   - Sends stop bit (logic high)
   - Sets *txdone* flag
   - Returns to IDLE state

   - cd
   - cd VSDSquadron_FM
   - cd uart_transmission
   - lsusb
   - make clean
   - make build
   - sudo make flash

That is all. The code is transmitted.


### Step 4: Testing and Verification

Steps of Testing and Verification

1. Install picocom in the terminal using command sudo apt install picocom

2. ls/dev/tty*

3. You can see dev/ttyUSB0

4. sudo picocom -b 9600 /dev/ttyUSB0

5. Then, check that a series of "D"s are generated and the RGB LED is blinking (switching between red, green and blue) .

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99f4b1b5-5ff1-4322-a496-f948859d66c3)
